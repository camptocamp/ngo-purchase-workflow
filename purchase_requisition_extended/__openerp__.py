This module improves the standard Purchase Requisition module.
==============================================================
This module allows to make calls for bids by generating RFQ for selected
suppliers, encode the bids, compare and select bids, generate draft POs.

First, a list of products is established. The call for bid is then confirmed
and RFQs can be generated. They are in the state 'Draft RFQ' until it is send
to the supplier and marked as 'RFQ Sent'. The bids has to be encoded and moved
to state 'Bid Encoded'. When closing the call for bids in order to start the
bids selection, all RFQ that have not been sent will be canceled. However,
send RFQs can still be encoded. Bids that are not received will remain in state
'RFQ Sent' and can be manually canceled.

Afterwards, the bids selection can be started by choosing product lines. The
workflow has been modified to allow to mark that the selection of bids has
occurred but without having to generate the POs yet, those can be created at a
new later state called 'Bids Selected'.

When generating POs, the are created in the state 'Draft PO' introduced by the
module purchase_extended.


Some fields have been added to specify with more details the call for bids and
prefill fields of the generated RFQs.


A link has been added between a call for bids line and the corresponding line
of each generated RFQ. This is used for the bids comparison in order to compare
bid lines and group then properly.
